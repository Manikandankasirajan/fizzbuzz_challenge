# 🧪 FizzBuzz — TDD + Clean Code + SOLID (Functional JavaScript)

This project is a clean, modular, and extensible version of the classic **FizzBuzz** challenge — developed step-by-step using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, **Clean Code**, and **SOLID principles**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Fully tested with **Jest**
- 🧩 Built with the **Red → Green → Refactor** TDD cycle
- 🧼 Follows **Clean Code** practices for readability and simplicity
- 🧱 Implements **SOLID principles** using functional architecture
- 🔁 Extensible rule-based design (e.g., easily add "Bazz" for multiples of 7)

## 🧠 Core Concepts Applied

| Principle | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **TDD** | Tests written before code to drive design (Red-Green-Refactor) |
| **Clean Code** | Meaningful names, small functions, modular structure |
| **SOLID** | SRP & OCP applied via independent rule functions |
| **Functional Programming** | Pure functions, no side effects, composable logic |
